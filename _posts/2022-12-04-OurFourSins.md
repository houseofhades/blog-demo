# Our Four Sins 

In the end, after all, were you just a sweet dream?  
Did you even exist in my life, or have I in yours?  
Chance happened to bring us both together  
But, sadly, Fate had different plans to scheme  
My poetry seems to remind me of you too much  
So, what was I supposed to do?   
Weep over my ink that only bled your name, to erase you  
Or hope that Luck gambles in the air between us  
Only to make sure Fortune intervenes
